Squezap is a minimalist quiz application where users can chose across 18 categories and also customise the number of questions and difficulty. A fun application to use when trying to pass time, test your knowledge or just trying to learn something new

#### “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” 
– Henry Ford
